At AutoSpoto, our story is rooted in the shared passion for music that binds us together. We are a trio of friends whose love for discovering and sharing tunes has always been at the heart of our friendship.

However, we felt that the experience of sharing music was inherently flawed. Tunes shared between each other would constantly be lost in the sea of messages.

Out of this problem, AutoSpoto emerged as our collective dream project, a manifestation of our desire to make music sharing seamless, spontaneous, and deeply personal.
